# Module Browser

The following visualization shows all of the modules in the [Course Sites]({{ site.baseurl }}/course-sites).

Each module is linked to the preceding and next module in that course. Modules are also linked to prerequisite modules from other courses. 

This network graph takes several seconds to stabilize. Please use the mouse to drag the graph into the center of the window. 

You can use the mouse to zoom in, zoom out, and pan around the network.

Hovering over a node will show a tooltip with the module description.

Double-clicking a node is intended take you to the corresponding module page.  *Note:* sometimes you might need to single-click, then double-click, for this function to work.
